**The Instructions**

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.


**The Data Set (mtcars)**

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

* [, 1]   mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon
* [, 2]	 cyl	 Number of cylinders
* [, 3]	 disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)
* [, 4]	 hp	 Gross horsepower
* [, 5]	 drat	 Rear axle ratio
* [, 6]	 wt	 Weight (lb/1000)
* [, 7]	 qsec	 1/4 mile time
* [, 8]	 vs	 V/S
* [, 9]	 am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
* [,10]	 gear	 Number of forward gears
* [,11]	 carb	 Number of carburetors

**Part 1: The Shiny Application**

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github


**Part 2: Reproducible Pitch Presentation**

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need:

* 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
* Your presentation pushed to github
* A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below

Your presentation must satisfy the following:

* It must be done in Slidify
* It must be 5 pages
* It must be on github
* It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
